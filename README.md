# From-Code-to-Conscious-Navigating-the-Ethical-AI-Landscape
AI Risk Navigator is a RAG-based chatbot that answers questions over risk and compliance PDFs using GPT, ChromaDB, and semantic search. Featured in From Code to Conscious, it demonstrates how LLMs can support ethical, explainable AI in high-stakes environments.

# 🧭 AI Risk Navigator

**AI Risk Navigator** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that enables contextual Q&A over internal risk, compliance, and policy PDFs. Powered by OpenAI's GPT models, SentenceTransformers, ChromaDB, FastAPI, and Streamlit, it provides explainable, source-grounded answers for high-stakes domains.

This project is featured in the book _From Code to Conscious: Navigating the Ethical AI Landscape_, and demonstrates how LLMs can be ethically leveraged to assist in AI-powered risk management.

## 🚀 Demo

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/demo.png" alt="AI Risk Navigator Chatbot Demo" width="80%">
</p>

- Ask risk-related questions like:
  > “What are the GDPR retention rules for transaction data?”
- View real-time responses with inline citations.
- Explore source documents directly via the UI.


## 🧠 Architecture Overview

**AI Risk Navigator** is composed of 5 core modules:

1. **PDF Processor**  
   Extracts, chunks, and tokenizes long policy or regulatory documents.

2. **Embedder**  
   Converts chunks into semantic vectors using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

3. **Vector Store (ChromaDB)**  
   Stores and retrieves top-k document chunks relevant to user queries.

4. **LLM Generator**  
   Constructs a contextual prompt from retrieved chunks and generates a grounded response using OpenAI’s GPT (`o1-mini`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, etc.).

5. **Frontend (Streamlit)**  
   Displays the chat interface, conversation history, and document sources.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Risk-Navigator.git
cd AI-Risk-Navigator
```
2. **Create a .env file**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
OPENAI_MODEL=o1-mini
DOCS_PATH=/app/data
CHROMA_DIR=/app/chroma_db
API_URL=http://backend:8000/chat
```
3. **Add your documents**

Place your PDF files in the ./data/ directory.

## Running the Project

Make sure you have Docker installed, then run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```
Access the chatbot at:

Frontend: http://localhost:8501

API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## **💬 Usage**

- Enter your question in the input box (e.g., "What’s the retention policy for financial records?").
- The chatbot retrieves relevant chunks from the indexed PDFs.
- GPT generates a response using the retrieved context.
- Expand Sources Used to view citation metadata.

## **⚠️ Challenges & Next Steps**

- Improve chunking strategy to better preserve semantic boundaries
- Add real-time document upload and re-indexing
- Optimize latency with asynchronous embedding + retrieval
- Extend to multimodal documents (e.g., scanned PDFs with OCR)
- Introduce user access control and audit logging
